            I have returned... <br><br>
            For a while I did not know what to write about this month, but then it hit me. <br><br>

            I like AI. AI is useful, but I want to use it when I want to use it. I think AI should be there when you need it, but not everywhere. Companies are shoving AI into everything (Microsoft and Google I am looking at you) and it is really getting annoying. Sorry Microsoft, but there is no reason to put Copilot into notepad or Microsoft Paint. Like make those programs decent in their original use first. <br><br>
            Like I literally learnt Wails just to code a simple text editor that does not have AI in it. Like really, if I want to write something, I do not want AI shoved into my basic apps. Like even Google has just announced that Google Chrome will have an AI button visible at all times. It does not matter to me, I gave up on Chrome a long time ago, and have since been using Zen Browser, an open-source fork of the Firefox browser. And then, in the android messages app, there is Gemini built into it. Like really, who is opening up messages if they want to talk to an AI chatbot? For that we have ChatGPT or other stuff. You can even just use a website. <br><br>
            Now, I do use AI a lot, to help me debug and to have smart auto-completions, but that is because I want it, not because big Corporations are wanting me to think "oooh they use ai soo modern wooow". Like Google literally changed their logo to have the fancy "AI" gradiants. Google, your logo was a lot better before, gradients just make it look weird. <br><br>
            Anyways, I am linking my wails text editor here if you want to download it, but be warned, Microsoft Defender will probably flag it as a virus, because it just never works. If you are scared, you can always compile from source I guess. <br><br>
