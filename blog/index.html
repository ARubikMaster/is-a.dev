            <h2 class="subtitle">AI is everywhere - Blog post 3</h2>
            <p class="description"><i class="description">24th of May, 2025</i> <br>
            I have returned... <br><br>
            For a while I did not know what to write about this month, but then it hit me. <br><br>

            I like AI. AI is useful, but I want to use it when I want to use it. I think AI should be there when you need it, but not everywhere. Companies are shoving AI into everything (Microsoft and Google I am looking at you) and it is really getting annoying. Sorry Microsoft, but there is no reason to put Copilot into notepad or Microsoft Paint. Like make those programs decent in their original use first. <br><br>
            Like I literally learnt Wails just to code a simple text editor that does not have AI in it. Like really, if I want to write something, I do not want AI shoved into my basic apps. Like even Google has just announced that Google Chrome will have an AI button visible at all times. It does not matter to me, I gave up on Chrome a long time ago, and have since been using Zen Browser, and open-source fork of the Firefox browser. And then, in the android messages app, there is Gemini built into it. Like really, who is opening up messages if they want to talk to an AI chatbot? For that we have ChatGPT or other stuff. You can even just use a website. <br><br>
            Now, I do use AI a lot, to help me debug and to have smart auto-completions, but that is because I want it, not because big Corporations are wanting me to think "oooh they use ai soo modern wooow". Like Google literally changed their logo to have the fancy "AI" gradiants. Google, your logo was a lot better before, gradients just make it look weird. <br><br>
            Anyways, I am linking my wails text editor here if you want to download it, but be warned, Microsoft Defender will probably flag it as a virus, because it just never works. If you are scared, you can always compile from source I guess. <br><br>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Learning Golang - Blog post 2</h2>
            <p class="description"><i class="description">19th of April, 2025</i> <br>
            A second blog post :O whaaaaaat <br><br>
            To be honest, I did not excpect to write this second blog post, but I ended up pleasently surprised wanting to update my website. <br>
            I will be trying to do a blog post per month from now on. Now lets get to the actual blog.<br><br>
            I love python. I think it is an amazing language, as you can essentially do anything with it. But lately I was noticing how much more of a backend language it is. Whenever I want to share my program to friends who do not have python installed, I have to use PyInstaller to do so, but it is well known that antyviruses hate PyInstaller, or any other python-to-exe programs. <br><br> So I decided it is finally time I learn a compiled language. I decided to learn golang for its blazingly fast speed, fast compile times and ease of use. <br><br>
            For now I did not learn a lot, but I still find it insanely easy to create a program. Libraries I am currently using (or rather learning for now) are ebitengine for games, even though I would usueally use Godot as game engines are easier and faster than libraries and gio, aka gioui for graphical user interfaces (gui). <br><br> 
            The language is very simple for me, the only things I do not completely understand when to use are interfaces, pointers and (sometimes) goroutines. But as it was when I was learning python as my first language, I am most certainly going to learn it gradually. <br><br> The biggest challenge for me will probably be the fact that golang has fewer pre made libraries and modules, as in python there always was one to do the hard work for me. But in the end of the day, that is more of a good thing, as it will make me have to think more like a programmer and build from scratch. <br><br><br>

            <h2 class="subtitle">My opinion on vibe coding - Blog Post 1</h2>
            <p class="description">
            <i class="description">28th of March, 2025</i></i><br><br>
            If you are a developper and have been online lately, you have probably heard of <i>Vibe Coding</i>, which is a trend that has been going around lately. It is essentially, getting LLMs (large language models) such as ChatGPT to write entire programs for you, as you <i>fully give in to the vibes</i>. To some, this sounds very appealing, but it is not scalable, and based off what I heard, debugging is a nightmare. <br><br> I think, that this is ridiculous. How can you call yourself a "developper", but then sit at your computer and nudge ChatGPT all day to write your code. I believe that ai is a great tool for programmers, and I personally use it to generate small snippets of code and to help me do some debugging. But using ai to write entire programs is just not a good idea. <br><br> As mentioned above, it is not scalable. For example, artificial intelligence is just basing itself off the content of the internet. So if you ever need to do something never done before, or at least documented on the internet, artificial intelligence will not be able to help you. And since you most definitely do not understand the code ai wrote for you, implementing it yourself will be a nightmare. <br><br> Then, there are security issues. Artificial intelligence does not always think of the possibility of people trying to hack into systems, and so often forgets to implement security measures. And even if it does implement it, ai generated security measures are not really great. <br><br> Finally, there is also the fact, that you do not learn anything when you are vibe coding. You might learn some <i>programming</i>, but probably no actual <i>coding</i>. The difference, is that coding includes the logical thinking that goes into writing code, and programming is just knowing the syntax. Knowing how to program is what you learn thru tutorials, but the only way to learn to code is by doing. Knowing programming but not coding is what causes tutorial hell, and programmers who can only code by vibe coding, or as I am calling it, ai hell. <br><br>
            But this is only my opinion, and as mentionned in at the top of the page, I am most definitely biased. This is all I have to say for now, but I might come back in the future to update this blog post.
