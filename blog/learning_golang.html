            A second blog post :O whaaaaaat <br><br>
            To be honest, I did not excpect to write this second blog post, but I ended up pleasently surprised wanting to update my website. <br>
            I will be trying to do a blog post per month from now on. Now lets get to the actual blog.<br><br>
            I love python. I think it is an amazing language, as you can essentially do anything with it. But lately I was noticing how much more of a backend language it is. Whenever I want to share my program to friends who do not have python installed, I have to use PyInstaller to do so, but it is well known that antyviruses hate PyInstaller, or any other python-to-exe programs. <br><br> So I decided it is finally time I learn a compiled language. I decided to learn golang for its blazingly fast speed, fast compile times and ease of use. <br><br>
            For now I did not learn a lot, but I still find it insanely easy to create a program. Libraries I am currently using (or rather learning for now) are ebitengine for games, even though I would usueally use Godot as game engines are easier and faster than libraries and gio, aka gioui for graphical user interfaces (gui). <br><br> 
            The language is very simple for me, the only things I do not completely understand when to use are interfaces, pointers and (sometimes) goroutines. But as it was when I was learning python as my first language, I am most certainly going to learn it gradually. <br><br> The biggest challenge for me will probably be the fact that golang has fewer pre made libraries and modules, as in python there always was one to do the hard work for me. But in the end of the day, that is more of a good thing, as it will make me have to think more like a programmer and build from scratch. <br>
