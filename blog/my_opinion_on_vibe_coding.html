            If you are a developper and have been online lately, you have probably heard of <i>Vibe Coding</i>, which is a trend that has been going around lately. It is essentially, getting LLMs (large language models) such as ChatGPT to write entire programs for you, as you <i>fully give in to the vibes</i>. To some, this sounds very appealing, but it is not scalable, and based off what I heard, debugging is a nightmare. <br><br> I think, that this is ridiculous. How can you call yourself a "developper", but then sit at your computer and nudge ChatGPT all day to write your code. I believe that ai is a great tool for programmers, and I personally use it to generate small snippets of code and to help me do some debugging. But using ai to write entire programs is just not a good idea. <br><br> As mentioned above, it is not scalable. For example, artificial intelligence is just basing itself off the content of the internet. So if you ever need to do something never done before, or at least documented on the internet, artificial intelligence will not be able to help you. And since you most definitely do not understand the code ai wrote for you, implementing it yourself will be a nightmare. <br><br> Then, there are security issues. Artificial intelligence does not always think of the possibility of people trying to hack into systems, and so often forgets to implement security measures. And even if it does implement it, ai generated security measures are not really great. <br><br> Finally, there is also the fact, that you do not learn anything when you are vibe coding. You might learn some <i>programming</i>, but probably no actual <i>coding</i>. The difference, is that coding includes the logical thinking that goes into writing code, and programming is just knowing the syntax. Knowing how to program is what you learn thru tutorials, but the only way to learn to code is by doing. Knowing programming but not coding is what causes tutorial hell, and programmers who can only code by vibe coding, or as I am calling it, ai hell. <br><br>
            But this is only my opinion, and as mentionned in at the top of the page, I am most definitely biased. This is all I have to say for now, but I might come back in the future to update this blog post.
