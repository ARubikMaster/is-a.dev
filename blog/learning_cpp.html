            I know that I started to learn Golang a couple months ago and am still very far from mastering it, but I was yet again surprised by how much of a backend language it is. For things like graphical user interfaces, I use wails, which uses html/css/js for frontend and Golang as a backend. That is completely fine for me, but if I want to make a game, the only good option seems to be Ebiten, which is a bit like Pygame that I have worked with before. However, it has no direct support for 3D games, and any frameworks in Golang that do support 3D graphics are poorly or not at all documented. <br><br>
            The best option for 3D games in Golang seemed to be g3n, but it is a bit outdated and has no documentation except a half written introdoction. So I decided to learn another language, specifically aimed towards using it for games. <br><br>
            After a bit of research, I found that C++ seemed to be the best option. I could have used C# with Unity, but I have always used frameworks for games, and the only time I used an engine, Godot, I found it hard to adapt. Also, engines sort of ruin the fun for me, as it does not feel as good as writing essentially everything from scratch int a framework that pretty much only takes care of the graphics. <br><br>
            I started to learn a bit about C++, and it was pretty fast to get used to for the basics, but I have not yet started to look into pointers, mostly because they are not needed for now. A few things I found weird was how you print to the console. In most languages you would have something like: print("Hello World!") or fmt.Println("Hello World!"), but in C++, it is std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl; <br><br>
            Another thing that took me some time to get used to is having to put semicolons after each line. Python supports them optionally, but I never used to, so I often forget to add them. Finally, I really do not like the errors in C++. They are so confusing that I basically have no other option than to use my IDE's (VSCode) debugger, which I don't ever use in other languages. I would usually just put print statements everywhere and see what would run to help me debug. <br><br>
            For my framework, I decided to use raylib. I am probably going to move to OpenGL later on, but for now it is way to low-level for me. I started by following a snake tutorial, then tried to make something myself. After making it in pygame to figure out the logic, I recreated my sand simulator in raylib. It is really just a cellular automota, but it still creates a nice effect. <br><br>
            This does not mean I am giving up Golang, in fact, I am only planning to use C++ for games, so anything from desktop apps to terminal apps will still be made in Golang, as I really like it's philosophy.
